accessibilityProblems:
  - On the 'Submitted returns' page, there is a breadcrumb trail that appears within the main landmark of the page, which means that the 'Skip to main content' skip link does not by-pass this block of repeated navigational content and fulfil the link's promised purpose of skipping to the main content of the page.
  - On the 'Check your answers â€“ period sales to country' page, there are summary cards, for each applicable VAT rate, that feature 'Remove' links whose visually hidden text is seemingly a code identifier, acting as a placeholder, rather than descriptive English text. This affects screen reader users, as it is not entirely clear from the link text what the purpose of the link is.
  - On the 'You have corrected the VAT amount for 1 country' page, there are two links that fail to provide sufficient context as to their purpose or destination.
  - On the 'Submitted returns' page, there are potentially multiple 'Pay now' links, but which provide no differentiating context to distinguish them from each other. This affects screen reader users, as there is no associated context provided to differentiate between the links.
  - On the 'Return submitted' page, when text is resized to 200%, the return reference code within the confirmation panel overflows its container. This affects low vision users who require resized text / magnification in order to be able to see content, as part of the content has been lost in overflowing its container.
