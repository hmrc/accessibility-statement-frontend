  -  On the page where you remove a benefit or expense, the structure of the page may make it difficult for users with screen readers to use the radio buttons.
  -  Some error messages in the service are not descriptive. This can make it hard for users to understand what they’ve done wrong.
  -  On the start page, users with screen readers may find it difficult to use one of the links. This is because the link is missing a description. This can make it hard for users with screen readers to understand the purpose of the link.
  -  On the start page, voice activation users may find difficulty using the links. This is because the links have been described as buttons.
  -  On the completion page, users with screen readers may find it difficult to use the link. This is because it is missing a suitable description and it doesn’t inform users that it will open a new page.
