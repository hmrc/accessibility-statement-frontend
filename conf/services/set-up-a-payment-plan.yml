accessibilityProblems:
  - The downloaded PDF ‘your payment plan’ does not have a document title which will make it difficult to correctly identify. The language for the document has not been set correctly, so screen readers may not pronounce the content correctly. Visual browsers may not display the characters and content correctly. When the document is magnified, the content does not reflow and needs horizontal scrolling which makes it more difficult to read.
  - The ‘set up Direct Debit’ page does not have a grouping label to tell screen readers how the form fields relate to each other.
  - On the 'Enter the code to confirm the email address' page the error prefix is not translated for Welsh speaking users, which could prevent them from correctly identifying text as an error.
  - On the 'Enter the code to confirm the email address' page users will not be able to select the input box by selecting the heading, as it has not been associated as the form control’s label.
