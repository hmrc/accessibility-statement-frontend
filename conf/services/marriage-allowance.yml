accessibilityProblems:
  - On several pages, the legends for the radio buttons are not descriptive enough and this can cause confusion for screen readers.
  - On several pages, there are page titles that are duplicated and this can cause difficulty for screen readers who need unique page titles to allow them to identify the page correctly.
  - Some pages where users need to enter a date don’t have a legend and this can cause problems for screen readers. It will be difficult to relate the date input to the question being asked as it will not be read out by the screen reader.
  - On several pages, there are no status messages on expandable radio buttons. This can cause problems for screen readers as they need to be told when expandable elements appear.
  - Throughout the service, the way that error messages are presented is not clear for users. This can cause problems in identifying the issue and correcting it.
