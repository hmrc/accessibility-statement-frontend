accessibilityProblems:
  - There are many parts of this service that users with accessibility issues may find difficult to complete. If it is not possible to complete your tax return online you can use the paper CT600 form, which you can request in an accessible format. Search the GOV.UK website for File your accounts and Company Tax Return, and scroll down to Other ways to file.
  - On many pages throughout this service the tab order is illogical which makes the focus move unexpectedly around the page for keyboard only users. Also, the keyboard focus completely jumps past some radio buttons, and keyboard only users are unable to place focus on these at all, which results in the journey being impossible to complete.
  - Throughout this service many links are confusing to understand, take users to unexpected locations, don’t describe where they go or what they do, and some use outdated and unlabelled icons. Firefox will display details components (or drop-down links) as regular links. Other links present more information on the page without indicating this to screen reader users. The links within the ‘progress’ sub-navigation areas can be confusing for some users, and many links take users to external websites without indicating this to screen readers. The Back link on many pages is often in the wrong place, and sometimes generates a “Confirm Form Resubmission” page. Keyboard only, screen reader and voice activation users will find many links confusing and disorienting.
  - Throughout this service, but particularly in the eligibility section, pages can be refreshed before many users have completed the tasks on them, and in many cases there are no options to continue from where the user left off. The timeout period of inactivity is too short, occurs without warning and does not give users the option to extend the session. This can be a frustrating experience for all users, but particularly for those using screen readers, for low vision users, and for users with panic disorder and anxiety issues.
  - Throughout this service there are forms that have fields that are unlabelled or non-descriptive which are confusing for screen reader users. Some buttons inform users that selection would expand content, but this does not function for users of JAWS 16 in Internet Explorer 11. Some buttons in the forms are placed inline with labels, not the form fields where data is entered, which causes difficulties for low vision users. Some optional fields are not marked as such for screen reader users which may cause confusion. Some of the formats required for correct entry in the fields is not explained beforehand to voice-over uses resulting in time-consuming delays. Some hint text explaining the format for numerical entry in the accounts section contains a comma - however using a comma subsequently causes an error which also creates confusion for many users with accessibility issues. There are also issues with colour contrast and visual cues in the forms which pose problems for low vision users. A lack of solid borders in some edit fields in the forms means locating them is difficult for low-vision users using a mouse pointer. The purpose of the form labels in the fields such as ‘AC12’ are not explained properly and this can cause confusion for deaf users, those with cognitive difficulties, and users of screen readers.
  - There are PDF documents in the service that lack headings in them and which can be very confusing for users of screen readers. Titles and links for the PDFs in the service are also not descriptive enough to enable users to understand the type of content that the document contains. They do not include the file name, file type and file size or whether or not it opens in a new window.
  - There are problems within the layout of various pages throughout this service that cause difficulties for users with accessibility issues. Some questions become hidden by the radio buttons which make completing the journey very difficult for users of mobile devices. Some radio buttons also appear vertically stacked whilst others are displayed horizontally. This inconsistency causes difficulty for users zoomed into the page at a high level. In some areas a 200% zoom causes text, images or controls to become shortened or obscured. The sub-navigation layout is also difficult to understand due to the different font weights, colours and sizes used. In some places the ‘Get help with this page’ link has no visual clue for its drop-down functionality causing confusion for those with low-vision issues. The left-hand navigation also has different font sizes and weights which can cause difficulties for low-vision users.
  - The navigation in this service is not clear and consistent, particularly in the 'progress sub-navigation' area. Links are labelled inconsistently, with some in bold and some not or some 'greyed' out and some not which is confusing. In the navigation menus there is a mixture of colour change, font size and linked text, making it difficult to follow for all users with accessibility issues. Many focus issues mean keyboard only users are redirected to illogical areas of the page. Some links do not clearly state that more content will appear as a result of activation, which causes problems for those using assistive technologies. The inconsistent default presentation of the navigation on each page causes difficulties for voiceOver users. Hidden content receives focus which means content is read out to voiceOver users that is not accessible on the page. There are also some inaccessible elements that are marked up to look like links but are not accessible to Voice Activation users and will also cause some issues for screen reader users, as they will see them as links but will be unable to activate them using neither the 'enter' key or the 'space' bar.
  - There are sections of this service that have hidden headings. The headings will read out incorrect results to screen readers on mobile which will cause confusion. The heading structure throughout is illogical and users of assistive technology such as Jaws and NVDA will be unable to relate content to heading structures. For desktop users there are sometimes two headings of the same size on a page with no logical hierarchical order, which causes problems for screen readers. There is also an instance where the heading content ‘Director transaction’ reads out incorrectly as a label, which is confusing for users of screen readers.
  - There are many tables in this service and many are not marked up correctly, and so don’t render correctly for users of assistive technologies. There are tables used to present information which are missing labels, headings, captions and descriptive summaries, making the information unclear for users of screen readers.
  - Page titles are duplicated throughout the process and are duplicated for each section. Page titles and the Error page titles are also in the wrong format. This is confusing and disorientating for all users as it is not clear that the page has changed or updated.
  - There are compatibility issues in this service that will cause difficulties for users of assistive technologies such as missing labels and descriptions for many fields, and improperly nested tags. Duplicate IDs occur on some pages and this causes issues for screen readers, and users of JavaScript methods like getElementById and querySelector. In the micro accounts section, unclosed elements and missing end tags mean screen readers may skip important content. There are many references to non-existent IDs which can result in assistive technologies relaying information incorrectly.
  - This service is not using GOV.UK new colour contrast changes. There are icons, links, headings and other features throughout this service that have low or poor colour contrast and so are difficult to navigate for colour blind and low vision users.

      Links displaying information about the ‘Status of a Submission’ in the service dashboard are not accessible to
      keyboard only or screen reader users. This is because the ‘click’ function only responds to mouse users. Also,
      many elements that are designed to be hidden off-screen until an action is made, such as selecting a radio button,
      are confusing for keyboard only users as the tab order is illogical. This makes the focus jump to the top of the
      page when tabbing through these hidden fields. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.1 - Keyboard Accessible, which
      requires all functionality of a service to be available from a keyboard. We are undertaking work to fix all these issues.

      There are elements in this service that appear visually as links, but are not accessible to voice activation or
      keyboard only users. There are also links that open in a new window but do not inform screen reader users this
      will happen, which can be disorienting for these users. Also, links in the ‘progress’ sub-navigation element are
      read to users as links that do not perform any function, which causes confusion. These issues fail WCAG 2.1
      Reference 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships - Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation
      can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
      They also fail WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.4 - Navigable, where ways should be provided to help users with accessibility
      issues navigate, find content and determine where they are. We are aware of the issues with the links in this
      service and will fix them all to be fully accessible.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      The service times-out after too short a period, and does not warn assistive technology users before-hand or give
      them the option to extend the session. Pages also refresh too quickly, with no option given to navigate easily
      back to where the user was in the service. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.2 - Enough time - provide users
      enough time to read and use content. We will make sure that users are not timed-out without warning
      and are given the option to extend the time-out period.
    date: 2023-03-31

      There are many problems with accessibility of the fields in this service. Radio buttons throughout the site have
      groupings that are not consistent. Many text area elements throughout the service are unlabelled. There are also
      fields that appear unlabelled to screen readers but are actually 'read only' text edit boxes. These issues fail
      WCAG 2.1 Reference 3.3 - Input assistance - help users avoid and correct mistakes, and WCAG 2.1 Reference 4.1 -
      Maximize compatibility - maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
      We intend to resolve all accessibility issues with the fields in this service.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      There are PDF documents in the service that do not include information about the file name, type and size and if
      it opens in a new window. Some PDF documents in the service lack headings for screen readers within the documents
      themselves. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.4 - Navigable, where ways should be provided to help users with
      accessibility issues navigate, find content and determine where they are. We will make sure all PDFs in the
      service are correctly labelled.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      Layout inconsistencies within this service mean that text is not easy to read due to proximity of other elements.
      In addition, text resizing causes text, images or controls to become truncated or obscured. Other layout problems
      mean navigation is not consistent. These issues fail WCAG 2.1 Reference 3.1 - Text content - make text content
      readable and understandable, and WCAG 2.1 Reference 3.2 - Predictable - make web pages appear and operate in
      predictable ways. We intend to fix the inconsistencies throughout the layout of this service.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      The navigation in this service is not clear and consistent. In many areas the focus is not logical and the user
      has to re-navigate the page. Elements with the same functionality are also not identified consistently.
      These issues fail WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.4: Navigable - provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and
      determine where they are. The navigation of this service is being updated and these issues should be fixed.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      We use headings in the service to introduce topics and guide users through the site. These are useful for screen
      readers as it lets them jump quickly to relevant content. Many headings are not structured in a logical and
      consistent way throughout the site, causing particular difficulties to users of screen readers.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.4 - Navigable - provide ways to help users with disabilities navigate,
      find content and determine where they are. We plan to make the headings in this site fully accessible.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      We use many tables in this service, however many are not marked-up correctly and are missing summaries, headings,
      captions and other elements that make navigating the tables difficult. Some tables are also incorrectly used just
      for layout purposes. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 1.3 - Adaptable - create content that can be presented in
      different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. The table elements also fail
      WCAG 2.1 Reference 4.1 - Maximize compatibility - maximize compatibility with current and future user agents,
      including assistive technologies. We plan to mark-up all tables within the service correctly.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      There are non-descriptive page titles present, and page titles do not change when progressing through the different
      steps. This occurs consistently throughout all stages of the service. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.4 -
      Navigable - provide ways to help users with disabilities navigate, find content and determine where they are.
      We are working to have all page titles correctly labelled.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      There are many inaccuracies in the mark-up which cause compatibility issues. There are improperly nested tags,
      duplicate IDs, duplicate attributes on the same element, a label element with a ‘for’ attribute that references a
      non-existent ID, and an ‘accesskey’ attribute value that is not unique. These fail WCAG 2.1 Reference 4.1 -
      Maximize compatibility - maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive
      technologies. We plan to fix all compatibility issues within this service.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      We use colour contrast to help low vision users navigate the service, however in many areas the expected colour
      contrast ratio of 4.5:1. was not in place. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 1.4 - Distinguishable content -
      make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
      We are working to have all colour contrast issues fixed in this service.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      On many pages, particularly in the eligibility section, the fieldset element does not have a name available to an
      accessibility API. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: |
      We use names anchor links within our error messages to allow users to easily see what part of a form a certain
      error applies to. However on many pages the link points to a named anchor within the page, but no anchor exists
      with that name. This fails WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks - a mechanism is available to bypass blocks
      of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.
