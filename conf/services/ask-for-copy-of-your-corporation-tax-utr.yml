  - the article tag appears before the heading at the start of the main content. This can make it more difficult for users with screen readers to locate the main content as it adds more noise
  - the skip to main content link moves the focus to the Welsh language switcher instead of the main part of the page 
  - the highlighted state of the selectable elements does not match the recommended colour contrast in the GOV.UK Design System

  - description: The highlighted state of the selectable elements does not match the recommended colour contrast in the GOV.UK Design System. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast). We plan to make the colour contrast stronger so that it matches what is recommended in the GOV.UK Design System.
