accessibilityProblems:
  - We are currently unable to warn you if you are about to be timed out, and we do not offer a way of extending
    the session time. This means that users with access needs are not always given adequate time to complete the task.
    This does not meet WCAG 2.1 (A) 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable.
  - Error message not associated with fieldset. This does not meet WCAG 3.3.1 Error Identification.
  - Fieldset missing legend. This does not meet WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.
