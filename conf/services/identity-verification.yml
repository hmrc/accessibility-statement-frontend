  This service allows you to confirm your identity online, which then gives

  credentials and their identity by asking a set of questions, helping us to be sure
  that the person using the service is who they claim to be.

accessibilityProblems:
  - We are currently unable to warn you if you are about to be timed out, and we do not offer a way of extending
    the session time. This means that users with access needs are not always given adequate time to complete the task.
    This does not meet WCAG 2.1 (A) 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable.
