serviceName: Get an Income Tax refund
serviceDescription: |
  P800 refunds is a service that allows customers to claim a tax refund via a ‘non-logged in’ user journey by requesting a bank transfer or claiming a Payable Order (cheque). In this way, customers can request a P800 repayment to be repaid to their account without logging into (or setting up) a personal tax account (PTA).
