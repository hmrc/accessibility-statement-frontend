  Find software that's compatible with Making Tax Digital for Income Tax
serviceDescription: |
  Making Tax Digital for Income Tax is a new way of reporting earnings to HMRC.
  It allows individuals or their authorised agents to sign them up to MTD for
  Income Tax, either voluntarily or because they are mandated.

  The mandation applies to business customers with either a self-employment
  business and or property business with a turnover greater than Â£10,000.

  Anyone who has signed up, or has been signed up, to MTD ITSA are the intended
  users of the service. They will be required to keep digital records for their
  business and submit income and expenses data to HMRC via software. The service
  will help them find an MTD  compatible software product, which has gone
  through the HMRC recognition process, that meets their business and personal
  needs; so that they can submit their data to HMRC and meet their MTD
  obligations.

    interrupting screen-readers' speech, making it difficult to understand.

    The accessibility features filters are ambiguous so users may not properly
    understand what they are selecting.
