accessibilityProblems:
  - Users are not being warned before being signed out when their session ends.
  - Screen-reader users will not be able to correctly identify the questions pages that include radio buttons or checkboxes, as the pages have not been set up correctly.
  - All text fields are missing labels that will make it difficult to understand what should be entered.
  - The HTML has not been set up correctly which can cause issues for assistive technologies or it does not display consistently across browsers.
  - On the 'Check the name and address for EORI number' page, the warning icon has no alternate text so its meaning is missing for screen-reader users.
  - Welsh users will find it difficult using the Welsh version, as the information on the service is not translated into Welsh.
  - The heading 'If we need to contact you about your application' does not provide sufficient context for users.
  - Users might find it difficult to correctly identify the question on the 'Select the most appropriate method to value your goods' page.
  - On the 'Your contact details' page, the name and telephone fields may not allow users to populate the information from data previously saved in their browser.
  - When users do not enter the commodity code, the error message informs users that the format is wrong instead.
  - When users try to upload a file in the right format, they get an error message that advises, 'You can only upload distinct files' which is wrong.
  - Screen-reader users are not notified about file upload status.
  - When using a small screen, such as on a mobile phone or when using increased font sizes, the EORI number on the 'Check the name and address for EORI number' page, does not fully fit on the screen.
