accessibilityProblems:
  - the service times out without giving users due warning or the option to extend their session
  - some of the instructions for the service are only shown in images rather than explained in text
  - some page titles, headings and links are not descriptive
  - not all labels and functions have been put in place for keyboard navigation and screen readers, so the information given to users may be incomplete, in the wrong order or unclear
  - pages cannot be formatted as a single column, which means users may have to scroll horizontally to find the information they need
  - users cannot skip to the main content when using keyboard navigation or a screen reader
