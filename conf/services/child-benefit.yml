serviceDescription: |
  This service enables claimants to view their proof of entitlement for Child Benefit and their payment details.
  It also allows them to change the account they use to receive payments and tell HMRC that a young person is staying in full-time non-advanced education so they can extend their Child Benefit payments.
note: This is a partially compliant service which has had automated testing and an audit by the HMRC accessibility team.
