accessibilityProblems:
  - Some buttons in the service act like links. Keyboard only users may have problems as they must use the enter key instead of the spacebar. Assistive technology users will have problems with these buttons as they have not been set up correctly.
  - When switching to Welsh on 'Income Tax' and 'Payment made to HMRC', there are links that remain in English and will not be pronounced correctly for screen readers.
  - Voice recognition users will not be able to directly access the 'Make a payment' button on the 'Balancing payment' page as the visible copy does not match the accessible label.
