accessibilityProblems:
  - Screen reader users may struggle to use some of the tables on the 'tax year overview' and 'next updates' pages. Some tables do not describe their purpose or the columns as a screen reader user moves between tables and cells.
  - The GOV.UK image link in the header links to the service home page instead of the GOV.UK home page.
  - Screen reader users may struggle to find correct values in the 'tax year overview' list. The description list is not identifying the label so some screen reader users will not know how many items are in the list.
  - Confirm your clients details may not correctly convey information for assistive technologies or display it inconsistently across browsers due to stray HTML tags.
  - Keyboard only users might struggle to use some of the buttons and will need to use the enter key instead of the spacebar. Links styled as buttons are not labelled correctly for assistive technology users.
  - The service link in the header on the 'tax year overview' page will be difficult to distinguish against the background in hover state due to the colour contrast.
  - When switching to the Welsh language on 'What is your client's Unique Taxpayer Reference?', the word 'error' remains in English and will be incorrectly pronounced for screen readers.
