accessibilityProblems:
  - On the ‘Evidence to support this appeal (optional)’ page, after users select a file to upload the markup for ‘file 1’ may mislead screen-reader users on its purpose.
  - The ‘penalty was issued more than 30 days ago’ copy is marked up as a label and does not describe the question that users need to answer. This will make it difficult for screen-reader users to understand the page.
  - Welsh users will have difficulties when using the Welsh version, as ‘skip to main content’ copy is not translated into Welsh.
  - On the ‘Evidence to support this appeal (optional)’ page, screen-reader users are not aware about any changes on the page when they upload a file or activate the ‘add another file’ button.
