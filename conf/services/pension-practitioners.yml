accessibilityProblems:
  - page titles do not always match page headers - this may cause issues for users with screen readers
  - keyboard-only users can't always skip to the main content on a page
  - screen readers will sometimes jumble up headers and sub headers
  - some cells in tables are missing audio-only descriptions, which is not good for screen readers
milestones:
  - description: The currency input pattern on fields where we ask for monetary amounts is not the latest version and may cause screen reader issues. This will be fixed by adopting the newly approved GDS currency input pattern.
    date: 2021-06-30
  - description: There are validation errors on some pages where data inputs are summarised that may cause issues with assistive technology. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) (A) and 4.1.1 (Parsing) (A). This will be fixed by patching the new pattern.
    date: 2021-06-30
  - description: The link focus colour is incorrect in some cards, caused by over-specific style sheet styling. This will be fixed by lowering the specificity of the CSS.
    date: 2021-06-30
  - description: Some tables use code that will cause issues with assistive technology. This will be fixed by updating the code used in tables.
    date: 2021-06-30
  - description: The spacing between page titles and body text is not always consistent and results in a disjointed user experience. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (A) (Info and Relationships). This will be fixed by using the CSS for styling.
