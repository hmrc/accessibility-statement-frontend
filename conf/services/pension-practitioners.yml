accessibilityProblems:
  - page titles do not always match page headers - this may cause issues for users with screen readers
  - keyboard-only users can't always skip to the main content on a page
  - screen readers will sometimes jumble up headers and sub headers
  - some cells in tables are missing audio-only descriptions, which is not good for screen readers
milestones:
  - description: The service times out after a while without presenting a way to extend the session time. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: Search inputs do not always have labels applied to them and do not always give sufficient instruction as to what is required for the input to work. Also, after submitting a search, the focus returns to the start of the page. This means that users who rely on a keyboard alone to navigate have to tab through all previous content to access the search results.  This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: Some headings on tables and confirmation pages are either missing or not properly marked up with the correct HTML. This may cause screen reader issues. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: Some links, headers and fieldset legends have incorrect or undescriptive content which impacts the ability to navigate the service. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: On one page, it is not clear that selecting a radio button reveals additional content. This means that users who rely on audio feedback technologies may be unaware that this content is available. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: The ‘sign out’ link text changes colour on focus. The colours used make the text difficult to read and means the link fails to meet the minimum required contrast ratio. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: Some errors are not clearly indicated within the title, status message or error summary of the page. This can prevent screen reader users from identifying that an error has occurred. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
    date: 2021-08-31
  - description: Postcode input fields have incorrect or misleading error messages. This can make the completion of these fields difficult. This will be fixed by 31 October 2021.
