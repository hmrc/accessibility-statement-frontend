accessibilityProblems:
  - not all labels and functions have been put in place for keyboard navigation and screen readers, so the information given to users may be incomplete, in the wrong order or unclear
  - in some places the background and foreground colours do not have enough colour contrast, making it harder for users to see and read the content
  - some of the images in the service do not have alternate text for people who have visual impairments or are unable to load images
  - some page titles, headings and links are not descriptive
  - users cannot skip to the main content when using keyboard navigation or a screen reader
