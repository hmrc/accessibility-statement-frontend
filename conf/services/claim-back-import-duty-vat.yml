accessibilityProblems:
  - Screenreader users may struggle to navigate certain pages, such as 'Check the Movement Reference Number (MRN) you entered', due to an incorrect heading structure.
  - Screenreader users may struggle to understand the tables on the site due to a missing column label.
  - On several pages, such as 'Choose repayment method', screenreader users may struggle to understand the purpose of radio buttons due to a missing label.
  - On the 'Enter the new deferment account number' page, users may struggle to enter the deferment account number due to a missing form field label.
  - Screenreader and keyboard users may struggle to navigate the 'Choose repayment method' page as they are not initially focused at the top of the page.
  - When navigating to a previously submitted page, information that had been submitted by the user is not maintained and the user has to re-enter the information.
  - On the 'Additional claim details' pages, the textbox label announced to voice activation users is not the same as the visual label, which might make it hard for voice activation users to navigate the page.
  - On the 'Movement Reference Number (MRN)' page, the message that appears when incorrect information is submitted does not sufficiently tell the user how to fix their issue.
  - On the document upload page, screenreader users do not get announcements about the progress of their document upload.
