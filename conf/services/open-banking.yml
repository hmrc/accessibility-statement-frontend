  - on the ‘Choose your bank’ page there is a further selection to make after choosing a bank - this additional component may be hidden for people using keyboard navigation
  - on the ‘Choose your bank’ page there is an error summary which does not highlight the input field - this may prevent some users from understanding what to do to fix the error
  - you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader
  - on some pages we display information in tables, which are not read out in a meaningful way by assistive technology
  - the printed payment confirmation contains some unnecessary information, such as hyperlinks
  - some headings are not consistent
milestones:
  - description: |
      Radio options on the 'Choose your bank' page are grouped in a way which prevents
      screen readers and other assistive technologies from reading their position in
      the list correctly. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).

      On the 'Choose your bank' page, users need to make an additional selection
      after choosing their bank. For people using voiceover software, the role
      of the additional selection is not clear and the service defaults to the
      first option. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).

      Some radio buttons on the 'Choose your bank' page are incorrectly identified
      as having a collapsed state, making the purpose of the radio button unclear
      to some users. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).

      There are some duplicated IDs on the 'Choose your bank' page, which may cause screen
      readers and other assistive technologies to only announce the first element.
      This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus Order).

      In some places within the service we display information in tables which
