  - The focus indicator does not give enough colour contrast.
  - The word ‘Error’ may not appear in the page title to alert screenreaders to an error.
  - Message counter in the subject of the message might be confusing.
  - The classes of headings are mixed so it is not always clear what is the relationship between elements on the page.
  - Page headings may be declaration reference numbers which do not convey clear meaning.
  - Subject of the messages is duplicated, and difficult to pronounce.
  - Incorrect usage of aria attributes could prevent screen readers from detecting some links or navigation.
  - Repeated use of main elements make it difficult to interpret the page formally.
  - Incorrect markup of tables means some elements may be shown incorrectly.
  - Use of the same links with different hypertext cause difficulty in understanding their function.
  - Long strings of text may be clipped if they cannot fit in the container width.
