accessibilityProblems:
  - HMRC’s screens are compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. However users visit their bank’s website or app to complete a payment. HMRC does not inspect each bank’s website or app so there might be some accessibility problems we don’t know about.
  - After selecting ‘approve this payment’, users are passed to their bank’s website or app to login and pay securely. Some of the individual bank’s accessibility statements indicate that their content may not be fully compliant to the standard that HMRC is obligated to meet.
