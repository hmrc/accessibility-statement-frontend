accessibilityProblems:
  - some error messages are not descriptive enough for people with visual impairments - but are compatible with common assistive technology tools
  - some headings are not consistent
  - elements which are missing their labels - using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide all the information needed
milestones:
  - description: This service uses radio buttons which are grouped so that the page can be
      navigated with only the keyboard. In some places, these groups are missing their
      labels which means screen reading software will not read out the description of the
      selected element. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).
