accessibilityProblems:
  - some error messages are not descriptive enough for people with visual impairments - but are compatible with common assistive technology tools
  - some headings are not consistent
  - elements which are missing their labels - using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide all the information needed
milestones:
  - name: add the correct labels and field sets to all of our radio buttons
    description: This service uses radio buttons which are grouped so that the page can be
      navigated with only the keyboard. In some places, these groups are missing their
      labels which means screen reading software will not read out the description of the
      selected element. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).

  - name: add consistent titles and headings for all the pages in the service
    description: We use tab titles to describe the content of our web pages. In some places,
      the tab titles do not match the heading of the page. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success
      criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).
