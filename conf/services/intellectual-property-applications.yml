accessibilityProblems:
  - There is no warning or option to extend the session in the timeout feature. Users are redirected to a timeout page.
  - The lists in the service are confusing for some screen reader users. A lot of information is contained in the one list, which is conveyed as one block of content when browsing out of context. There are also nested lists which can make it difficult to determine the layout of the page.
  - The auto-complete feature is problematic for users of assistive technology.  While gaining focus in the input field that contains the auto-complete, there are no instructions to inform the user how to interact with it.
  - Duplicated links take users to different destinations. This is a problem for a screen reader browsing out of context as each link takes users to different destinations.
  - There are links in the service that open as a PDF, but users are not aware of this prior to its initiation. The file type should be made clear within the hypertext, so users are aware that they will be taken to a document.
  - The links within one of the tables in the service are not descriptive of the goods that the user will be changing or removing.
  - Error validation is not triggered when an incorrect character is included in a field.
  - Users with assistive technology, like screen readers, may find it hard to identify and select links in tables when using table shortcut keys.
  - Visually impaired users might have problems seeing the frames around buttons, text boxes, checkboxes and radio buttons because the contrast is not high enough. The current visible focus indicator colour contrast does not meet the required ratio. Some field labels do not provide enough information for users to understand what is required.
  - When the browser magnification is set to 400% and the browser width is 1280px, content overlaps each other. This will affect low vision users who require larger text to be able to read the page.
  - Some links open in a new tab without making it clear what will happen in advance. Visually impaired users could be affected if they are not aware that a new tab has opened.
milestones:
  - description: There is no warning or option to extend the session in the timeout feature. Users are redirected to a timeout page. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 (timing adjustable). We will warn users their session is about to timeout or give them the option to extend their session.

  - description: The lists in the service are confusing for some screen reader users. A lot of information is contained in the one list, which is conveyed as one block of content when browsing out of context. There are also nested lists which can make it difficult to determine the layout of the page. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships. We will mark up sections like this as a definition lists.

  - description: The auto-complete feature is problematic for users of assistive technology.  While gaining focus in the input field that contains the auto-complete, there are no instructions to inform the user how to interact with it. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value). We will implement an accessible auto-complete.

  - description: Duplicated links take users to different destinations. This is a problem for a screen reader browsing out of context as each link takes users to different destinations. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (link purpose). We will ensure each link is descriptive and conveys the destination to the user.

  - description: There are links in the service that open as a PDF, but users are not aware of this prior to its initiation. The file type should be made clear within the hypertext, so users are aware that they will be taken to a document. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (link purpose). We will ensure the file type is included within the link text.

  - description: The links within one of the tables in the service are not descriptive of the goods that the user will be changing or removing. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (link purpose). We will make sure each link is descriptive.

  - description: Error validation is not triggered when an incorrect character is included in a field. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.1 (error validation). We will make sure error validation is triggered when a mistake is made.

  - description: Users with assistive technology, like screen readers, may find it hard to identify and select links in tables when using table shortcut keys.This does not meet WCAG 2.1 1.3.1 (info and relationships). We will make sure that all table links have descriptive labels, and can be clearly associated with descriptive table headers.

  - description: Visually impaired users might have problems seeing the frames around buttons, text boxes, checkboxes and radio buttons because the contrast is not high enough. The current visible focus indicator colour contrast does not meet the required ratio. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (non-text contrast). We will make sure the colour contrast ratio for adjacent colours meets the minimum required ratio of 3:1.

  - description: When the browser magnification is set to 400% and the browser width is 1280px, content overlaps each other. This will affect low vision users who require larger text to be able to read the page. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow). We will ensure users can view the page in one column with no loss of content, or without requiring scrolling in two directions.
    date: 2021-01-31
  - description: Some links open in a new tab without making it clear what will happen in advance. Visually impaired users could be affected if they are not aware that a new tab has opened. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.5 (change on request). We will ensure that all links that open in a new tab are clearly labeled.
