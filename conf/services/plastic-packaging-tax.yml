accessibilityProblems:
  - text content may be difficult to read by low vision users due to the colour contrast of foreground and background colours – however, sufficient contrast ratio between text and background colours are in place
  - acronyms may not be expanded in the first instance – however, expanded content will be used instead to ensure that users are able to determine what service they are accessing; this is particularly important for users who may experience cognitive difficulties
  - the page structure may not follow the typical format
  - page titles may not always match the heading of the page – however, where possible, the heading of the page and the page title content will be matched
  - where numeric data is required, the input mode may not be correctly specified – however, the input mode attribute will be set to numeric
  - no validation triggering – however, validation will be implemented
  - the header component may not follow the typical pattern – however, the right pattern will be implemented for consistency
  - upon selecting a 'change' link to amend data, the inputs on the page loaded have been cleared – however, the right pattern will be implemented
  - the period of inactivity before the timeout triggers is very short – however, a greater period of time before the timeout will be implemented
