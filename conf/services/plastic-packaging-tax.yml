      A button is present that has insufficient description to enable screen reader users to easily determine the button’s purpose and what it relates to. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels. This will be fixed by adding additional text to the button so that its purpose is clear to screen readers.

      Although the presence of an error is described in text, the presentation of the error message makes it difficult for some users to rectify the error. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.3 Error Suggestion. This will be fixed by updating the error messages to include more helpful information.
