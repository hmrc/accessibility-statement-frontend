accessibilityProblems:
  - On the ‘Cash account‘ and ‘Manage your account authorities‘ pages, the table column layout is changed visually for smaller screens but this information is not relayed to screen-reader user.
  - The downloaded CSV files includes columns with a mixture of data so it is difficult to identify related content.
  - The downloaded PDFs and CSV files do not have a document title set, so users may not correctly identify what the content is.
  - Voice recognition users will not be able to directly access some links as the visible copy does not match the accessible label.
  - The downloaded PDFs do not have the correct language set for the document. Screen-readers may not pronounce the content correctly.
  - The downloaded PDFs do not reflow the content when zoomed. This means horizontal scrolling is needed which makes it difficult to read. 
  - On the ’Which Import VAT certificates do you need?’ page, the input field in error is not easily identifiable as there is no error message associated with it
