accessibilityProblems:
  - on the ‘Enter declaration details’ page, the date of import validation does not work well as the error not clearly identifies which field is incorrect.
  - on the ‘Enter the claim amount’ pages, currency input does not have error identification. It does not allow to enter a value with pound symbol, spaces and commas, which will affect speech recognition users. And people with motor impairments who rely on pasting copy from somewhere else.
  - on the ‘Enter declaration details’ and ‘Enter bank account details’ pages, error messages do not describe correctly what is wrong and what the user needs to do to correct it.
  - the account header and some content do not fit on the screen when the user needs to increase font size. that might cause issues for people with motor impairments who need to scroll to access this information.
  - not translated copy is not marked up correctly for pronunciation for screen readers.
