accessibilityProblems:
  - On the 'reporting de minimis aid payments (less Customs Duty waivers) as a single undertaking' page, the heading is not set up correctly so that screen reader users do not know that it is a heading
  - On the 'report a de minimis aid payment' page, the table is stacked on smaller screens but has not been correctly set up which can cause confusion for screen reader users
milestones:
  - description: Content visually presented as a heading does not have the correct code semantics to identify it as the heading.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.
