accessibilityProblems:
  - On various pages throughout the service, data previously added by users is not kept when they return using the back link. When returning to the 'What is the postcode of the residential property' page using the change link from the 'Check your answers' page, the previously entered postcode is lost.
  - When reviewing the addresses on the 'What is the address of the residential property?' page, the house number order is not numerically listed.
  - On the 'What is the address of the residential property?' page, the country field does not allow users to use the data saved in their browser.
  - On the search pages when the page is zoomed or viewed on a small screen, the size and spacing of the 'View' and 'Remove' links is not enough to avoid accidental activation of the adjacent link.
