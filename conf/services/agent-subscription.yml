accessibilityProblems:
  - Users may find it difficult when they need to re-enter their answers when returning to previously answered steps throughout service.
  - Users may find it difficult to identify errors on the 'Clients details' page as the error message for the radio buttons is missing.
  - Users may be confused when the back link on the ‘What is the company registration number of your business?’ page does not go back to the previous step.
  - Screen-reader users may find it misleading when they navigate to the ‘What are your pending money laundering supervision registration details?’ page, as the page title announces a different name for this page.
  - Users may find it difficult to visually identify the name of the country displayed on the ‘Change your address' page and screen-reader users may miss it altogether, as their screen-reader will not announce disabled fields.
  - Users may be mislead by what needs to be corrected when they encounter errors on date entry pages throughout the service.
  - The trading name field on the ‘What is the trading name of your business?’ page does not allow the browser to autofill saved organisation names. This can create difficulties for people with motor and cognitive impairments.
  - Users may be mislead by the error message with what needs to be corrected when they try to enter the name of the country on the ‘Your main trading address’ page.
