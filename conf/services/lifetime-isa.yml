accessibilityProblems:
  - when using the service on a small screen, the menu button disappears after it has been clicked
  - on every page the focus colours are not contrasting enough. This can make the text more difficult to read
  - on the page where you have to enter a reference number, the field expects a telephone number
  - on some fields, the autocomplete function is missing. This means you will have to enter your answers manually rather than allowing your browser to fill it in for you 
  - when entering your company’s reference number, you can only enter an uppercase ‘Z’. The error message says you should enter a lowercase ‘z’. This could be especially confusing if you use a screen reader
  - on every page the link to the accessibility statement does not allow assistive technologies to easily interpret the content
  - the link to sign out does not allow assistive technologies to easily interpret the content
  - there is content in the footer that could be read out by screen readers that should not be there
  -   there is a logo in the footer that should not be set as a link and a heading
  - on every page, the back link is included in the main content. This can make it more time consuming to find the main content of the page
  - on some pages the heading and page title is different
  - when there is an error on the page, the word ‘error’ does not appear
  - on some pages, the article tag appears before the heading at the start of the main content. This can make it more difficult for screen readers to locate the main content as it adds more noise
  - on every page, the back link and the menu toggle appears on the page if you have disabled javascript. However the back link and the menu toggle only work when javascript is enabled. 
  - the link to ‘Get help with this page’ is not announced when it is actioned. This can be confusing for screen readers.
