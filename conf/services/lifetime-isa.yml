accessibilityProblems:
  - on the page that asks for your company’s reference numbers, there is a problem with the error messages. If you use a screen reader and face an error, it will be difficult for you to work out what’s gone wrong. You will have to work through the whole page to find the error.
  - on the check your answers page, the table might be difficult to read if you’re using a screen reader. To avoid this issue, you should use Firefox, Chrome or Safari.
  - the service does not tell you when it’s about to timeout. This means you won’t know when your data is about to be deleted. It will timeout after 15 minutes if you’re inactive.
  - on the page that asks for your company’s details, the fields are not connected. This can make it difficult for users with screen readers to interpret the information and answer the questions.
  - on the confirmation page, the text is clipped when you’re zoomed in at 200%. This means that users that magnify the page will miss part of the information.
