accessibilityProblems:
  - The items table on the ‘Select an item to give information about’ page have not been correctly implemented for smaller devices. The content of the table for screen readers does not match how it is presented visually.
  - The legend on the ‘Do you want to give information about item 1 having broken seal(s)?’ and ‘Do you want to give information about item 2 being damaged?’ does not have an understandable question for screen-reader users.
  - Screen-reader users will find it difficult to work out how the ‘Check your answers before submitting your receipt’ page is structured. Heading levels that visually show grouping do not indicate the same grouping to screen-reader users.
  - When using a small screen, such as mobile devices or when increasing font sizes, the content on some pages does not fit on the screen properly.
