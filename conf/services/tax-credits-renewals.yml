accessibilityProblems:
  - Throughout the service, users are timed out without warning after a period of inactivity. This can be time consuming for users who may take longer to use the service.
  - On the page to renew your tax credits, there is more than one main heading. This can create confusion for screen reader users to know when the main content starts.
  - Throughout the service, keyboard users can access content in the ‘Your account’ link that should be hidden. This may surprise users who would not expect to be taken to these links.
  - Throughout the service, a link for ‘Your account’ opens when activated. However, the link can no longer be accessed if screen reader users try to go back to it.
  - Throughout the service, when opening the link for ‘Your account’, options are read as expandable. By telling users content is expandable when it is only a link will take users to the wrong place.
  - On the confirmation page, there is no main heading. This may confuse screen reader users that rely on headings to introduce the main content.
  - On the tax credits awards page, visually hidden text does not relate to the information shown. This may confuse screen reader users as it is not clear how the information applies to them.
  - Throughout the service, the mobile menu icon is read out to screen readers with no context. This can be extremely confusing for screen reader users who may not know what the icon represents.
  - On the tax credits awards page, screen readers read out hidden text rather than button labels. This can be confusing to screen readers who won’t know what the button will do.
  - For mobiles, on the ‘Did you get any of these benefits’ page, screen readers didn’t announce that the content would expand when selected. This content also didn’t open when using a spacebar or enter key on a keyboard. This stops certain users from accessing all of the available information.
  - Across the service, some information incorrectly tells screen readers to announce content when reaching a page. This will be unexpected to screen reader users and cause confusion.
  - On the report changes page, an ‘open all’ link is used to expand content. However, there is no descriptive text to tell screen reader users what this link will do.
