accessibilityProblems:
  - some of the buttons are not descriptive enough for screen readers, and do not make sense out of context. We plan to change the buttons so they refere back to the question asked.
  - some numerical values are not updated in line with the actual amount needed to answer the question. We will update the numerical value so it no longer just reads '0' for screen readers.
  - a few questions are described as a series of letters and symbols on screen readers, instead of words. In future we plan to check every line of descriptive text, and rewrite them to fix it.
  - some pages do not read out the error state text for people who use screen readers. We will fix this so an error state loads and is read out with the rest of the page.
  - some questions are visually different to the words read out by a screen reader. We will fix this by checking each visual question and described question, and make sure that they match.
  - some of the page titles and page information is read out twice by a screen reader because the designs do not follow the gov.uk pattern. We will fix this so that all of the information is only read once, and in the right context.
