accessibilityProblems:
  - On the ‘What is the name and tax reference of the pension scheme?’ page and selected others, there are multiple H1 headings which is confusing, as screen-reader users are not getting the same information as other users.
  - On the ‘Have you contributed to any other defined benefit or defined contribution scheme?’ page and selected others, there is text that visually appears to be a heading, but is not marked up as a heading, affecting screen-reader users.
  - On the ‘check your answers’ pages, links appear to have placeholder text, rather than the same text as the label, affecting screen-reader users.
  - On the ‘Enter bank details’ page, it has not been set up correctly so that screen readers will announce ‘view-bank-details-hidden’, which does not provide enough context for users.
