accessibilityProblems:
  - when using a keyboard to navigate, or a screen reader you cannot skip to the main content
  - some labels for screen readers and keyboard navigation may be missing, repeated or in the wrong order
  - the service displays some questions only when previous ones are answered, this may cause stress for users who are unable to answer them in one go
  - some pages can be refreshed before many users have completed tasks and with no option to continue from where they left off
  - the timeout period for inactivity is too short, occurs without warning and does not give users the option to extend the session
  - the service is not using GOV.UK new colour contrast changes so some features may be difficult to navigate for colour blind and low vision users

      The menu toggle sometimes disappears on a small screen.
      Also, when JavaScript is switched off, it unnecessarily appears (as there is a single sign out link).

      The service displays some information, known as conditionally revealed content,
      only when users need to see it. In some cases, multiple questions are revealed.

      The service times out too quickly and does not warn assistive technology users
      or give them the option to extend the session.
      Pages also refresh too quickly, with no option given to navigate easily back to where the user was in the service.
      This does not meet WCAG 2.1 Reference 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable.

      We use colour contrast to help low vision users navigate the service,
      however in some areas the expected colour contrast ratio of 4.5:1. was not in place.
      There is not enough contrast between text and background for people with moderately low vision to read without contrast-enhancing technology.
      These issues do not meet WCAG 2.1 Reference 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum).
