accessibilityProblems:
  - When switching to Welsh, some pages in the service are missing Welsh translations. They appear with unreadable messages in English. These messages will not be pronounced correctly for screen-reader users.
  - Screen-reader users presented with incorrect and mismatching questions alongside the visually displayed questions when they navigate to form elements such as text fields and radio buttons.
  - On the ‘goods profile’ page, the remove and change links do not provide sufficient context for screen-reader users to determine where the link will take them.
  - On the ‘asking HMRC for advice’ page, the warning icon does not have alternative text that describes the warning icon’s meaning for screen-reader users.
  - The table on the ‘goods profile’ page does not fit on the viewport width, it forces 2 dimensional scrolling for the rest of the content on the page which can be difficult for people with motor impairments to navigate.
  - Name and email fields do not allow users to autofill personal information from their browser on the ‘what is your name?’ and ‘what is your email address?’ pages.
