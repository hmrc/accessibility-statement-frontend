accessibilityProblems:
- On the 'What type of goods do you want to add?' pages, screen-reader users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of the radio options as the questions are not correctly associated with them.
- On the 'Do you have evidence this item was originally produced or made in the EU?' page, screen-reader users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of the radio options as the question is not correctly associated with them.
- On the 'What is your email address?', 'What are your journey details?' and 'Add goods to your previous declaration' pages,
  screen-readers will not read out the hint or error messages when moving directly to the input fields as the page has not been set up properly.
- On the 'Payment complete', 'Tax due on these goods' and 'Additional tax due on these goods' pages,
  screen-reader users may struggle to understand the tables as they do not describe their purpose or distinguish the columns and rows correctly.
- The back link does not always take users back to where they came from.
- On the 'Payment complete' page, the service name link in the header does not take the user back to same page where they started.
- On the 'Which number will you use to prove your identity?' page, the data added by users is not kept when they return using the back link.
- On the 'Add goods to your previous declaration' page, the last name field does not allow users to use the data saved in their browser.
- When switching to the Welsh version, on some pages the hidden 'error' prefix available to screen-reader users has not been translated. These will not be pronounced correctly for screen-reader users.
- Check your answer pages are not always provided to allow users to review the information before submitting their declaration.
