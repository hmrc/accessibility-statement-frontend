accessibilityProblems:
  - There is one parsing error in this service. This might cause screen readers to read out the content in a confusing order.
  - For one of the input fields, the accessible name does not match up to the visual label. This might make the service harder to navigate for speech-based users and text-to-speech users.
milestones:
  - description: On the National Insurance and Paye As You Earn Sevice screen there is a parsing error. The error is 'Attribute aria-expanded not allowed on element input at this point'. Parsing errors in code can cause serious issues with a userâ€™s understanding or interaction with content. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing).

  - description: The 'Payment amount' text box has the accessible name of 'Enter amount in pounds'. People who navigate the service using speech, or text-to-speech will have a worse experience reaching this field because the labels do not match. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.5.3 (Label in Name).
