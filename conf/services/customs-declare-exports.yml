accessibilityProblems:
  - Headings are not always positioned correctly in the page code, making it difficult to use heading shortcut keys.
  - The hidden wording does not always reflect the purpose of the input fields.
  - Some buttons are positioned incorrectly in the page code, which could make browsing more time-consuming for screen reader users.
  - Hint information may be positioned incorrectly in the page code, which means screen readers may read it twice.
  - The word ‘Error’ may not appear in the page title to alert screen readers to an error.
  - The heading and the page title do not always match.
  - Error validation may not be triggered by the ‘Save and continue’ button when fields are left blank.
  - Some error messages do not describe the error.
  - Users may be timed out of the service with no prior warning.
  - ‘Your session will time out soon’ is in a duplicate font size that could perform badly on a screen reader.
  - There is no alert to stop users writing too many characters in text boxes.
  - Navigation landmarks may be duplicated without a unique description to indicate what each navigation section contains.
  - Optional input fields may not be marked as being optional.
  - The link colour is not consistent with other GOV.UK services.
  - The thematic break (horizontal rule) element has been used where it is not necessary.
  - Some information boxes do not have a descriptive label.
  - There are some unexplained abbreviations in the service.
  - Some links that open a new tab do not advise the user this will happen.
  - The ‘Create an Export Accompanying Document (EAD)’ button does not indicate a file type or file size.
  - The ‘Remove procedure code’ table has a misleading heading for screen readers.
  - The ‘Back’ link does not follow the recommended style on all pages.
  - The address fields do not always follow the recommended style.
