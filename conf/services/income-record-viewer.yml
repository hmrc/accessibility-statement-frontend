accessibilityProblems:
  - On the ‘income records’ page, users with screen readers may find it difficult to identify the type of content in the ‘record’ column. The column heading announces ‘record’ which could mislead users to think that the column contains values when it actually contains links to view records.
  - On the page where you can select a tax year to view, users with screen readers may find it difficult to understand the content of the page. This is because the language has been set to Welsh when the user will expect the page to be read in English.
  - On the page where you view an income record, users with screen readers may find it difficult to understand the structure of the page. This is because incorrect heading levels have been used in the table.
