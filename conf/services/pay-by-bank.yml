accessibilityProblems:
      - HMRC’s screens are compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. However users visit their bank’s website or app to complete a payment.
      - HMRC does not inspect each bank’s website or app so there might be some accessibility problems we don’t know about.
      - After selecting ‘approve this payment’, users are passed to their bank’s website or app to login and pay securely.
      - Some of the individual bank’s accessibility statements indicate that their content may not be fully compliant to the standard that HMRC is obligated to meet.
