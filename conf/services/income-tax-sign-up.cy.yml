  - where we use 'show me an example' in a link, we have not said that this is to show an example of accounting methods
  - certain screen readers do not move to the top of the page when a new page is loaded
  - if you go back to a previous page, some of the information you already entered will not always be shown - you may need to re-enter it
  - some of our error messages will not help you to understand what the error may be or how to fix it
  - the 'Back' link does not always appear below the Welsh language toggle
