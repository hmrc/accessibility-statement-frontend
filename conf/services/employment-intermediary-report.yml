serviceDescription: |
  Employment intermediaries must send information to HMRC about workers they have placed in work but who fall outside
  of their PAYE/RTI system. This service lets employment intermediaries meet their legislative reporting requirements
  by providing a platform where they can upload their reports to HMRC.

accessibilityProblems:
  - users are not warned before being signed out when their session ends.
  - when a report is successfully uploaded, this update is not communicated to screen-reader users.
  - on the tax-year selection page, the label for the group of options is not set up correctly. This makes it difficult for screen-reader users to know what they are being asked to do. The correct copy is present in the heading before it.
  - on the summary page, the links for uploading a report do not make it clear to screen-reader users which year the link will upload a report for. This information is provided after the link.
  - on the page displayed after sending a report, the page title alone does not help the user to understand what the page is about. This makes it more difficult to identify the page in a series of browser tabs and can be especially problematic for screen-reader users.
  - the ‘you’re no longer an intermediary’ page’s title is the same as the previous page, which can make it difficult for screen-reader users to know that the page has changed.
  - when reviewing uploaded files the information is visually laid out as a table, but the way it has been set up means it can only be navigated by screen-reader users as if it were standard text.
  - the image used on the confirmation page has alt text which does not make sense in the wider context.
  - when the ‘is this page not working properly?’ link is clicked, a form appears after the link. This change is not communicated to screen-reader users.
  - the PDF document which lists errors in uploaded data is missing language information, a document title, alt text on images, heading structure and tables without the correct structure for assistive technology.
  - some content may cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear at higher zoom levels or on smaller screens.
